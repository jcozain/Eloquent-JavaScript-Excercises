 ## Credit

 All credit for the mind behind the creation of the excercises should be given 
 to [Marijn Haverbeke](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/), the only thing i have done
 is doing the excercises by myself and with a little help of the [code sandbox](http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/).

 I aprecciate the author of this book for the great knowledge he has passed on to us and
 recommend reading this book to anyone eager and curious of what programming in javascript
 really looks like.
